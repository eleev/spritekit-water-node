# spritekit-water-node-ios-app
Custom `SpriteKit` node that allows to sumulate 2D water with respect to physics ðŸŒŠ The app demonstrates `Flocking` behaviour using `GameplayKit`, `key-frame animation` and custom `fragment shader chaining` (`GLSL`) ðŸ¤¯. Feel free to play around and hopefully get some inspiration!

# Caution
- Please note that you have to be very careful if you are going to use the repo in commercial projects - **do not use** graphics assets. The assets were taken from [Kenny](https://kenney.nl) and [icons8.com](https://icons8.com) and are free to use. However **I strongly recommend to double check it**.
- The code is not perfect - there are `magic` numbers such as `zPosition` of nodes and several pieces can be better organized.
