    ///   - pattern: is a closure that accepts string and int (as key and index) and returns string that decribes naming pattern
    ///   - indices: is an instnace of ClosedRange<Int> type that specifies index boundaries of uploading nodes (for instnace you want to upload a set of nodes that describe sky and are called "cloud" - there are 3 clouds: "cloud-1", "cloud-2", "cloud-3" - the method helps to upload them using a singe function)
